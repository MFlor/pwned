# Pwned [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/MFlor/pwned.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/MFlor/pwned)
#### A PHP library for interacting with [HaveIBeenPwned.com's](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2) API

This package wraps the entire HaveIBeenPwned API in a simple, easy to use, PHP library, that can be used in any project.

Many other packages wrapping the API, are either supposed to be used in a framework, or only wraps the password checker.

## Installation

```bash
composer require mflor/pwned
```

### Setup

<?php

// Require composers autoloader
require_once './vendor/autoload.php';

$pwned = new \MFlor\Pwned\Pwned();
```

];
